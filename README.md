# Getting Started with Create React Autocomplete

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Autocomplete](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

1. Pull the project from [Github](https://github.com)
2. run `npm install`
3. `npm start` to start dev server
4. `npm run build` then `npx serve -s build` for prod server testing

### Please Note
 Searching works only for firstName because of fake API endpoint which is used here

 Try:
   Ter, Te, Terry, Jo, John and etc....

We have **.env** and **.env.production** files where we are defining API endpoints for dev and prod servers.

Additional params can be added there
